            <h2>My Journey</h2>
            <p>My journey in IT began with a curiosity for how websites work. I started learning HTML and CSS in high school, which sparked my interest in web development. During my degree, I explored cloud technologies, particularly AWS, and gained hands-on experience with server setup and deployment. I’ve since worked on various projects, from building responsive websites to configuring secure cloud infrastructure.</p>
